## Ditching Derivatives with duopy
This is a work in progress for a `Python` module written in `C++`. It will provide users an efficient and accessible interface for working with dual numbers. Currently, the `C++` code runs and enables basic dual number arithmetic.

**What are dual numbers?**

Dual numbers are a creation of the *Autograd* world of machine learning. They are similar to complex numbers, in that they extend the number system by adding an orthogonal plane to the real number plane. This new plane is called the dual *e* (epsilon), where *e^2* = 0. 



### Work in progress
 Missing: effective wrap for the `C++` code for `Python` interface.
